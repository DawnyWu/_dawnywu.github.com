`var FN_ARGS = /^function\s*[^\(]*\(\s*([^\)]*)\)/m;`

* `/ˆ` We begin by anchoring the match to the beginning of input
* `function` Every function begins with the function keyword. . .
* `\s*` . . . followed by (optionally) some whitespace. . .
* `[ˆ\(]*` . . . followed by the (optional) function name - characters other than ‘(’. . . 
* `\(` . . . followed by the opening parenthesis of the argument list. . .
* `\s*` . . . followed by (optionally) some whitespace. . .
* `(` . . . followed by the argument list, which we capture in a capturing group. . . 
* `[ˆ\)]*` . . . into which we read a succession of any characters other than ‘)’. . .
* `)` . . . and when done reading we close the capturing group. . .
* `\)` . . . and still match the closing parenthesis of the argument list. . .
* `/m` . . . and define the whole regular expression to match over multiple lines.
